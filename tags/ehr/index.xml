      <description>&lt;p&gt;The D2V Analytics core was asked by the UCHealth system to evaluate the predictive performance of a proprietary sepsis prediction model developed the Epic Corporation. This project, led by Dr. Bennett, culminated in a report and presentation to the senior leadership of the adult health care system. My role on the project was that of data scientist. A podium abstract was presented at the 2018 AMIA 2018 symposium. The analysis has also been accepted for presentation in abstract form at the Epic Expert User Group Meetings (XGM) in May 2019. A manuscript is currently under review at a peer-reviewed journal.&lt;/p&gt;
