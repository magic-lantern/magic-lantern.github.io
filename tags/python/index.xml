      <description>There are many barriers to data access and data sharing, especially in the domain of machine learning on health care data. Legal constraints such as HIPAA protect patient privacy but slow access to data and limit reproducibility. Kung Faux Pandas is an end-to-end system called Kung Faux Pandas for easily generating de-identified or synthetic data which is statistically similar to given real data but lacks sensitive information. This system focuses on data synthesis and de-identification narrowed to a specific research question to allow for self-service data access without the complexities required to generate an entire population of data that is not needed for a given research project.</description>

      <description>Work in Progress&amp;hellip;
This Analytics example is meant to demonstrate a few of the things you can do to analyze data stored in Google BigQuery using Python. Originally developed some time ago, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d clean it up and post it here.
For those that aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with BigQuery, it is a &amp;lsquo;serverless&amp;rsquo; database system that is fully managed and always available. Instead of charging per environment/instance/hour of time like many cloud database systems, Google charges based on the amount of data a query processes.</description>
