      <description>While there are many options for profiling C++ (or other compiled code) on Linux, many of those tools are difficult to get working correctly with R. Additionally, profiling R code with C++ is complicated due to different settings between various commonly use OSes. While there are some blog posts and presentation materials available on the Internet, many miss important steps that take some effort to determine the correct solution to resolve.</description>

      <description>Motivation Version 2 of the Pediatric Complex Chronic Conditions (CCC) system was published &amp;ldquo;Pediatric complex chronic conditions classification system version 2: updated for ICD-10 and complex medical technology dependence and transplantation&amp;rdquo; by Chris Feudtner, James A Feinstein, Wenjun Zhong, Matt Hall and Dingwei Dai.
SAS and STATA scripts to generate CCC categories from ICD codes were provided by Feudtner et al. as an appendix to the above manuscript. However, those scripts can take many hours to run on large datasets.</description>
