&lt;h2 id=&#34;about&#34;&gt;About&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an infomatician and experienced software engineer I help with the crucial effort of improving health care and reducing health care costs through the appropriate use of information technology. My experience and education provides me with the ability to develop requirements, build solutions, and test the success of a chosen solution. I have experience with commercial software such as Cerner Millennium Electronic Health Record (EHR) and Oracle Hyperion, standards based platforms such as SMART on FHIR and InfoButtons, and build from scratch tools and techniques. My domains of interest are clinical information retrieval and extraction, imaging informatics, quality control and reporting, and the use of standards to improve the exchange of information as well as consistency of clinical care. As a software engineer and informatics researcher I&amp;rsquo;m always excited to try new tools and techniques and then make recommendations for their continued use or abandonment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coming Soon:&lt;/em&gt; CV&lt;/p&gt;
